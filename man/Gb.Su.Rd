\description{
A physically based formulation for the canopy boundary layer conductance.
}
\details{
The formulation is based on the kB-1 model developed by Massman 1999. 
         Su et al. 2001 derived the following approximation:
          
         \deqn{kB-1 = (k Cd fc^2) / (4Ct ustar/u(zh)) + kBs-1(1 - fc)^2}
         
         If fc (fractional vegetation cover) is missing, it is estimated from LAI:

         \deqn{fc = 1 - exp(-LAI/2)}
         
         The wind speed at the top of the canopy is calculated using function
         \code{\link{wind.profile}}.
         
         Ct is the heat transfer coefficient of the leaf (Massman 1999):
         
         \deqn{Ct = Pr^-2/3 Reh^-1/2 N}
         
         where Pr is the Prandtl number (set to 0.71), and Reh is the Reynolds number for leaves:
         
         \deqn{Dl wind(zh) / v}
          
         kBs-1, the kB-1 value for bare soil surface, is calculated according 
         to Su et al. 2001:
         
         \deqn{kBs^-1 = 2.46(Re)^0.25 - ln(7.4)}
         
         Rb for water vapor and heat is assumed to be equal. Rb for CO2 (Rb_CO2) is given as:
 
         \deqn{Rb_CO2 = 1.37 * Rb}
 
         The factor 1.37 arises due the lower molecular diffusivity of CO2 compared to water.
         It is lower than the ratio of the molecular diffusivities (Dw/DCO2 = 1.6), as movement
         across the boundary layer is assumed to be partly by diffusion and partly by turbulent
         mixing (Nobel 2005).
