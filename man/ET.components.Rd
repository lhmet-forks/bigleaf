\value{
a data.frame with the following columns:
        \item{ET_eq}{equilibrium ET (kg m-2 s-1)}
        \item{ET_imp}{imposed ET (kg m-2 s-1)}
        \item{LE_eq}{equilibrium LE (W m-2)}
        \item{LE_imp}{imposed LE (W m-2)}
}
\description{
Evapotranspiration (ET) split up into imposed ET and equilibrium ET.
}
\details{
Total evapotranspiration can be written in the form:

         \deqn{ET = \Omega ET_eq + (1 - \Omega)ET_imp}
         
         where ET_eq is the equilibrium evapotranspiration rate, the ET rate 
         that would occur under uncoupled conditions, where the heat budget
         is dominated by radiation (when Ga -> 0).
         
         \deqn{ET_eq = (\Delta * (Rn - G - S) * \lambda) / (\Delta + \gamma)}
         
         and ET_imp is the imposed evapotranspiration rate, the ET rate
         that would occur under fully coupled conditions (when Ga -> inf):
         
         \deqn{ET_imp = (\rho * cp * VPD * Gs * \lambda) / \gamma}
}
\note{
Surface conductance (Gs) is calculated with \code{\link{surface.conductance}}.
      Aerodynamic conductance (Ga) can be calculated using \code{\link{aerodynamic.conductance}}.
