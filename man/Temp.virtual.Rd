\title{Virtual temperature}
\usage{
Temp.virtual(Tair, pressure, VPD, constants = bigleaf.constants())
}
\arguments{
\item{Tair}{Air temperature (deg C)}

\item{pressure}{Air pressure (kPa)}

\item{VPD}{Vapor pressure deficit (kPa)}

\item{constants}{Kelvin - conversion degree Celsius to Kelvin}
}
\value{
virtual temperature (deg C)
}
\description{
Virtual temperature, defined as the temperature at which dry air would have the same
             density as moist air at its actual temperature.
}
\details{
the virtual temperature is given by:
 
 \deqn{Tv = (Tair+273.15)(1 + 0.61*q)}

  VPD is converted to specific humidity (q in kg kg-1) with VPD.to.q() internally.
}
\note{
mixing ratio is approximated by specific humidity.
