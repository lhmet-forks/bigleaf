\description{
Calculates meteorological conditions at the big-leaf surface
             by inverting bulk transfer equations for water, energy, and carbon
             fluxes.
}
\details{
Canopy surface temperature and humidity are calculated by inverting bulk transfer equations of
         sensible and latent heat, respectively. 'Canopy surface' in this case refers to 
         the surface of the big-leaf (i.e. at height d + z0h; the apparent sink of sensible heat and water vapor).
         Aerodynamic canopy surface temperature is given by:
         
         \deqn{Tsurf = Tair + H / (\rho * cp * Ga)}
         
         Vapor pressure at the canopy surface is:
         
         \deqn{esurf = e + (LE * \gamma)/(Ga * \rho * cp)}
         
         Vapor pressure deficit (VPD) at the canopy surface is calculated as:
         
         \deqn{VPD_surf = Esat_surf - esurf}
         
         Note that Ga is assumed to be equal for water vapor and sensible heat.
         Ga is further assumed to be the inverse of the sum of the turbulent part
         and the canopy boundary layer conductance (1/Ga = 1/Ga_m + 1/Gb; 
         see \code{\link{aerodynamic.conductance}}). If Ga is replaced by Ga_m (i.e.
         only the turbulent conductance part), the results of the functions represent
         conditions outside the canopy boundary layer, i.e. in the canopy airspace.
