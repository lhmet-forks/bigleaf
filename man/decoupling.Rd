\description{
The canopy-atmosphere decoupling coefficient 'Omega'.
}
\details{
The decoupling coefficient Omega ranges from 0 to 1 and quantifies the
         linkage of the conditions (foremost humidity and temperature) at the canopy surface
         to the ambient air. Values close to 0 indicate well coupled conditions
         characterized by high physiological (i.e. stomatal) control on transpiration
         and similar conditions at the canopy surface compared to the atmosphere above
         the canopy. Values close to 1 indicate the opposite, i.e. decoupled conditions and 
         a low stomatal control on transpiration (Jarvis & McNaughton 1986). \cr
         The "JarvisMcNaughton_1986" approach (default option) is the original
         formulation for the decoupling coefficient, given by (for an amphistomatous 
         canopy):
         
         \deqn{\Omega = \frac{\epsilon + 1}{\epsilon + 1 + \frac{Ga}{Gc}}}{%
         \Omega = (\epsilon + 1) / ( \epsilon + 1 + Ga/Gc)}
         
         where \eqn{\epsilon = \frac{s}{\gamma}}{\epsilon = s/\gamma} is a dimensionless coefficient
         with s being the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve (Pa K-1), and \eqn{\gamma} the 
         psychrometric constant (Pa K-1).
         
         The approach "Martin_1989" by Martin 1989 additionally takes radiative coupling
         into account:
         
         \deqn{\Omega = \frac{\epsilon + 1 + \frac{Gr}{Ga}}{\epsilon + (1 + \frac{Ga}{Gs}) (1 + \frac{Gr}{Ga})}}{%
         \Omega = (\epsilon + 1 + Gr/Ga) / (\epsilon + (1 + Ga/Gs) (1 + Gr/Ga))}
