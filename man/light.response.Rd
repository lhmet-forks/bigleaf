\value{

\description{
calculates GPPmax at a reference (mostly saturating) PPFD and 
             ecosystem quantum yield using a rectangular light response curve.
}
\details{
A rectangular light response curve is fitted to NEE data. The curve
         takes the form as described in Falge et al. 2001:
         
         \deqn{NEE = \alpha PPFD / (1 - (PPFD / PPFD_ref) + \alpha 
                      PPFD / GPPmax)- Reco}
                      
         where \eqn{\alpha} is the ecosystem quantum yield (umol CO2 m-2 s-1) (umol quanta m-2 s-1)-1, 
         and GPPmax is the GPP at the reference PPFD (usually at saturating light). \eqn{\alpha} 
         represents the slope of the light response curve, and is a measure for the light use
         efficiency of the canopy. 
         
         The advantage of this equation over the standard rectangular light response
         curve is that GPPmax at PPFD_ref is more readily interpretable
         as it constitutes a value observed in the ecosystem, in contrast to 
         GPPmax (mostly named 'beta') in the standard model that occurs at infinite light.
         PPFD_ref defaults to 2000 umol m-2 s-1, but other values can be used. For 
         further details refer to Falge et al. 2001.
}
\note{
Note the sign convention. Negative NEE indicates that carbon is taken up
        by the ecosystem. Reco has to be 0 or larger.
