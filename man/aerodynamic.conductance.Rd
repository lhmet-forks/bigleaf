\description{
Bulk aerodynamic conductance, including options for the boundary layer conductance
             formulation and stability correction functions.
}
\details{
Aerodynamic conductance for heat (Ga_h) is calculated as:

    \deqn{Ga_h = 1 / (Ra_m + Rb)}
 
 where Ra_m is the aerodynamic resistance for momentum and Rb the canopy boundary
 layer resistance ('excess resistance').
 
 The aerodynamic resistance for momentum Ra_m is given by:
 
    \deqn{Ra_m = u/ustar^2}
 
 Note that this formulation accounts for changes in atmospheric stability, and does not require an
 additional stability correction function. 
 
 An alternative method to calculate Ra_m is provided
 (calculated if \code{wind_profile} set to TRUE):
 
    \deqn{Ra_m = (ln((zr - d)/z0m) - psi_h) / (k ustar)}
 
 If the roughness parameters z0m and d are unknown, they can be estimated using
 \code{\link{roughness.parameters}}. The argument \code{stab_formulation} determines the stability correction function used 
 to account for the effect of atmospheric stability on Ra_m (Ra_m is lower for unstable
 and higher for stable stratification). Stratification is based on a stability parameter zeta (z-d/L),
 where z = reference height, d the zero-plane displacement height, and L the Monin-Obukhov length, 
 calculated with \code{\link{MoninObukhov.length}}
 The Stability correction function is chosen by the argument \code{stab_formulation}. Options are 
 \code{"Dyer_1970"} and \code{"Businger_1971"}.
 
 The model used to determine the canopy boundary layer resistance (Rb) is specified by 
 the argument \code{Rb_model}. The following options are implemented:
 \code{"Thom_1972"} is an empirical formulation based on the friction velocity (ustar) (Thom 1972):
 
   \deqn{Rb = 6.2ustar^-0.667}
   
 The model by Choudhury 1988 (\code{"Choudhury_1988"}), calculates Rb
 based on leaf width, LAI and ustar (Note that in the original formulation leaf width
 instead of the characteristic leaf dimension (Dl) is taken):
  
    \deqn{Gb = LAI((2a/\alpha)*sqrt(u(h)/w)*(1-exp(-\alpha/2)))}
    
 The option "Su_2001" calculates Rb based on the physically-based Rb model by Su et al. 2001,
 a simplification of the model developed by Massmann 1999:
 
    \deqn{kB-1 = (k Cd fc^2) / (4Ct ustar/u(zh)) + kBs-1(1 - fc)^2}
 
 The models calculate the parameter kB-1, which is related to Rb:
 
    \deqn{kB-1 = Rb * (k * ustar)}
 
 Both kB-1 and Rb, as well as Gb are given in the output.
 
 Rb (and Gb) for water vapor and heat are assumed to be equal. Rb for CO2 (Rb_CO2) is given as:
 
    \deqn{Rb_CO2 = 1.37 * Rb}
 
 The factor 1.37 arises due the lower molecular diffusivity of CO2 compared to water.
 It is lower than the ratio of the molecular diffusivities (Dw/DCO2 = 1.6), as movement
 across the boundary layer is assumed to be partly by diffusion and partly by turbulent
 mixing (Nobel 2005).
}
\note{
The roughness length for water and heat (z0h) is not returned by this function, but 
      it can be calculated from the following relationship (e.g. Verma 1989):
      
      \deqn{kB-1 = ln(z0m/z0h)} 
      
      it follows:
      
      \deqn{z0h = z0m / exp(kB-1)}
      
      \code{kB-1} is an output of this function.
      
      Note that input variables such as LAI, Dl, or zh can be either constants, or
      time varying (i.e. vectors of the same length as \code{data}).
