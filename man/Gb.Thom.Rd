\description{
An empirical formulation for the canopy boundary layer conductance
             based on a simple ustar dependency.
}
\details{
The empirical equation for Rb to water suggested by Thom 1972 is:
 
 \deqn{Rb = 6.2ustar^-0.67}
 
 Rb for water vapor and heat is assumed to be equal. Rb for CO2 (Rb_CO2) is given as:
 
 \deqn{Rb_CO2 = 1.4 * Rb}
 
 The factor 1.4 arises due the lower molecular diffusivity of CO2 compared to water.
 It is lower than the ratio of the molecular diffusivities (Dw/DCO2 = 1.6), as movement
 across the boundary layer is assumed to be partly by diffusion and partly by turbulent
 mixing (Nobel 2005).
